            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a developer in unity <br>
            I am 17, my pronouns are she/her and my favourite color is <br>
            purple. I made 3 games so far: Deep-Dive-Dash a game about <br>
            getting as deep as possible in an ocean, a roguelike in <br>
            which you have to make it through a castle and an arcade <br>
            game where you have to survive in space for as long as possible.
